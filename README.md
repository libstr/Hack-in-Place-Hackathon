# Hack-in-Place-Hackathon
## Project description 
The COVID pandemic poses not just a huge health risk but also a mental one to our communities. This is most evident in the case of the elderly, who suffer from extreme isolations. 
Our “Soundscape of Your Love” audio archive provides a creative solution to this issue by giving the elderly a means to stay connected with their peers, both distant and close, while sheltering at home. They are able to record and post messages of love and encouragement and listen to others' recordings as well. 
We hope that the elderly can find consolation and community this way.
